What is intention creation?

Intention creation is the idea that what you intend is indeed what you manifest. In other words, what you think about or what you intend, subconsciously or consciously, is what eventually manifests. Your predominant thoughts are what manifest in your reality. The Law of Attraction and intention creation are both interconnected.
